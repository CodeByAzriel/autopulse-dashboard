Data-Driven Automotive Consumer Insights Platform

Overview

AutoPulse Dashboard is a prototype analytics platform designed to transform raw consumer interaction data into clear, actionable insights for automotive manufacturers and dealerships.

Rather than relying on intuition or fragmented reports, AutoPulse centralizes engagement data—such as vehicle interest, comparisons, and abandoned selections—into structured dashboards that support strategic decision-making.

This project demonstrates how automotive companies can better understand what customers consider, what they hesitate on, and where interest is lost, using data visualization and structured tables.

Problem Statement

Automotive brands collect vast amounts of customer data, yet much of it remains underutilized or siloed.
As a result:

Consumer intent is difficult to interpret

Abandoned vehicle selections are not analyzed

Product, pricing, and marketing decisions rely heavily on assumptions

AutoPulse addresses this gap by converting engagement data into interpretable metrics and trends.

Key Features

Most Considered Vehicles
Displays which vehicles receive the highest attention from users.

Abandoned Selections Analysis
Highlights where customers disengage before completing a selection—valuable for identifying friction points such as pricing, features, or availability.

Engagement Tables
Structured datasets that differentiate between vehicles, models, and interaction frequency, ensuring meaningful comparisons rather than flat metrics.

Clean, Executive-Ready UI
Designed to reflect a premium automotive brand aesthetic—clear, minimal, and insight-focused.

Example Real-World Use Cases

1. Automotive Manufacturers (e.g. Porsche)

Identify which models generate interest but fail to convert

Optimize vehicle configurations and pricing strategies

Support product planning with real consumer behavior data

2. Dealership Networks

Track customer interest trends across regions

Improve sales conversations using data-backed insights

Adjust showroom inventory based on demand patterns

3. Marketing & Strategy Teams

Measure campaign effectiveness

Detect early shifts in consumer preferences

Reduce wasted spend by targeting high-intent segments

Business Model Concept

AutoPulse is envisioned as a B2B SaaS platform, not a consumer-facing product.

Possible access models:

Subscription-based dashboard access

Tiered analytics packages (basic insights → advanced predictive analytics)

Enterprise licensing for manufacturers and dealer groups

This repository represents an early-stage prototype, focusing on foundational logic, data flow, and dashboard presentation.
