✨ Overview

AutoPulse Dashboard is a prototype analytics platform designed to turn raw automotive consumer interaction data into clear, meaningful insights for manufacturers and dealerships.

Instead of relying on gut feeling or scattered reports, AutoPulse centralizes engagement data—such as vehicle interest, comparisons, and abandoned selections—into a clean, executive-ready dashboard that supports smart, data-backed decisions.

This project showcases how automotive brands can better understand:

What customers are most interested in

Where hesitation occurs

Why potential buyers disengage

All through structured data and visual insights.

❓ The Problem

Automotive companies collect large volumes of customer data, but much of it is underutilized.

Common challenges include:

🚫 Difficulty interpreting real customer intent

🚫 No visibility into abandoned vehicle selections

🚫 Decisions driven by assumptions instead of data

AutoPulse addresses this gap by transforming engagement data into actionable trends and metrics.

🔑 Key Features

⭐ Most Considered Vehicles
Identifies which cars attract the most attention and interest.

🛑 Abandoned Selections Analysis
Highlights where customers drop off before completing a selection—useful for detecting friction points such as pricing, features, or availability.

📊 Engagement Tables
Structured datasets that clearly differentiate between vehicles, ensuring meaningful comparisons rather than flat or misleading metrics.

🎨 Premium Dashboard UI
Clean, minimal, and insight-focused—designed to align with high-end automotive brands.
